The biggest trend of 2025 is "pimple patches," "snail mucin," and "hair growth oils." Amazon classifies these as "Topicals." The Problem: Amazon often rejects these listings claiming they are "Medical Devices." The Solution: The seller needs a website that uses specific "Cosmetic" language to prove it’s not a drug.
Key Feature: A "Science" page that explains how it works (without making medical claims).

Pet owners are buying "Calming Chews" and "Paw Balms" like crazy. The Problem: Amazon creates "Pesticide" flags for anything that goes on a pet. The Solution: A website showing the ingredients are natural/organic.
Key Feature: "Vet Recommended" Badge and a "Safety Promise" section.

Sellers are desperate to get the "Climate Pledge Friendly" badge on Amazon because it boosts sales by 10%. The Problem: To get the badge, they often need a website page explaining their "Sustainability Mission." The Solution: You sell them a "Green Compliance" site.
Key Feature: A dedicated "Sustainability" page (replacing the "Ingredients" page).

New sellers are importing "Smart Bird Feeders," "Nugget Ice Makers," and "Air Purifiers." The Problem: These items break. Customers return them if they can't figure them out. The Solution: A "Support Hub" website to prevent returns.
Key Feature: A "Download Manual" button and "Video Setup Guide" section.
